AlgoGenie: Autonomous DSA Problem Solver
Core Purpose
AlgoGenie is an agentic AI system designed to solve Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. Unlike standard LLMs, it autonomously writes, executes, and verifies code within a secure, isolated Docker environment to ensure the logic is bug-free and efficient.

Tech Stack
Framework: Microsoft AutoGen (AgentChat)

Execution Environment: Docker (DockerCommandLineCodeExecutor)

LLM Engine: Groq API (Llama-3.3-70b-versatile)

Frontend: Streamlit

Orchestration: Round Robin Group Chat with Text-Mention Termination

System Architecture
The system employs a collaborative two-agent loop:

DSA Problem Solver Agent: Analyzes the task, creates a step-by-step logic plan, and writes the Python implementation with integrated test cases.

Code Executor Agent: Manages the runtime. It spins up an isolated Docker container, executes the code, and feeds the output or error logs back to the solver for iterative debugging.

AlgoGenie — Autonomous DSA Solution Engine | Python, AutoGen, Docker, Streamlit, Groq API

Engineered a multi-agent system utilizing DockerCommandLineCodeExecutor to autonomously solve and verify DSA problems in a secured, isolated sandbox.

Implemented a RoundRobinGroupChat orchestration logic allowing for iterative self-debugging between a Solver Agent and an Execution Agent.

Architected a real-time Streamlit dashboard that streams agent dialogue and execution logs, leveraging Llama-3.3 via Groq for high-speed reasoning.
